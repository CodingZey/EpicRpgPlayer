This will automaticllay play for you 


Where it says {userid} enter your discord user ID  
Where it says {DiscordAuth} enter your discord auth (see: https://youtu.be/DArlLAq56Mo?t=203 
(to open developer tools you need to press ctrl shift i ))
Where it says {ChannelId} enter the channel ID where the message should be posted 

I know this isn't the best way to do it but for me it works just fine 



You need to change the code and save it in .py to launch the code download python open command prompt and type pip install requests 
THen you should be good to go and you can run the code
